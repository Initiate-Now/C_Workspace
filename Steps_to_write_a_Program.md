# Steps to writing a Program

## 1. Understand the Problem

**Define the Objective:** Know what the program is supposed to accomplish.

**Identify Constraints:** Recognize any limitations (e.g., memory, execution time).

**Gather Requirements:** List inputs, outputs, and specific features.

## 2. Plan the Solution

**Break Down the Problem:**
Divide the task into smaller, manageable pieces.

**Choose an Algorithm:**
Select the approach for solving the problem.

**Create a Flowchart or Pseudocode:**
Use diagrams or pseudocode to visualize the steps.

## 3. Write the Code

Start with a basic structure:

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main() {
        // Your code here
        return 0;
    }
Implement the solution incrementally:
* Write one function/module at a time.
* Test each part before proceeding.

## 4. Compile and Build

* Use a compiler or an integrated development environment (IDE) to convert your code into an executable format.
* Resolve any syntax errors.

## 5. Test the Program

* Test the program with different inputs, including edge cases.
* Validate if the output matches expectations.

## 6. Debug if Necessary

* Debugging is the process of finding and fixing program errors.
* Use debugging tools or techniques to identify and fix issues (logical or runtime errors).

## 7. Optimize the Code

* Improve performance, readability, or resource usage.
Minimize complexity if needed.

## 8. Document the Program

* Add comments to explain complex logic.
Create external documentation for users and developers.

## 9. Maintain the Code

* Be prepared for updates, bug fixes, or additional features.
* Use version control (e.g., Git) for tracking changes.

**NOTE :**

    * Should develop the habit of planning before coding(Don't skip step 1 & 2).
