# Display Output 

In C, the printf function is primarily used to display output. It is part of the <stdio.h> library, which stands for "Standard Input/Output."

## Key Notes
* printf is case-sensitive: Printf or PRINTF will cause an error.
* #include <stdio.h> is required: It includes the standard I/O functions like printf.
* Use format specifiers carefully: Ensure the type of variable matches the format specifier to avoid unexpected output.
* Combine escape sequences and format specifiers for better formatting.
