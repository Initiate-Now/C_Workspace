# Comments in C

Comments in C are used to explain or annotate the code to make it more readable and maintainable. Comments are ignored by the compiler during compilation and do not affect the execution of the program.

## Types of Comment

* C supports two types of comments:

  * Single-line comments
  * Multi-line comments

### 1. Single-line Comments

* Single-line comments begin with //.
* Everything after // on the same line is treated as a comment.
* Syntax:

        // This is a single-line comment

### 2. Multi-line Comments

* Multi-line comments begin with /* and end with */.
* They can span multiple lines and are used for longer explanations or disabling large blocks of code.
* Syntax:

        /* 
        This is a multi-line comment.
        It can span multiple lines.
        */

## Use of Comments

1) **Improving Code Readability**
* Comments help describe the purpose of the code, making it easier for others (or your future self) to understand.

2) **Code Documentation**
* Comments can document:

  * Functionality of the code
  * Author details, version, and date
  * Inputs, outputs, and algorithms

3) **Debugging**
* Comments can help disable specific lines of code temporarily for debugging purposes.
